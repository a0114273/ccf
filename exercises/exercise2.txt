----Part 2 
1. Let us now play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
2. Find one image for rock, one for paper and one for scissors. 
3. We will add these to our web page. 
4. Can you google search how to add images to your webpage? 
5. Save your project and make sure that you can see the images through your webpage. 
6. Now let us edit the images size and make them appear in the center using css.
7. Add a <button> to our webpage so that when we click the button, we can make the computer choose which image (Rock, Paper or Scissors?) does it want. 
		<button type="button">Play!</button>
8. Save the page and notice that you can see the button but when you click it, nothing happens. This is because we have not added any logic for the computer to choose the image. For that we need <script>.  
9. Add onClick attribute to the button so that it knows what to do when we click the button. Edit your button tag like this:
		<button type="button" onClick="console.log('Hi, I am your computer!')">Play!</button>
10. Save the file and click the play button. What happens? Where does the "Hi, I am your computer!" message go?
11. This is a very important skill as a computer genius that you should know, its know as debbugging.
